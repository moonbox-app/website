      <p>All plants need love and care to thrive ðŸª´ðŸ’•</p>
      <p>
        ðŸŒŠðŸŒ› Did you know that the moon influences the balanced development of
        all things made of water, including plants?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were to follow the recommendations based on the current moon
        sign, phase and its aspects with the planets, then your indoor plants
        will receive optimal care, become stress resilient, and will grow and
        flower well. This approach is also known as the biodynamic calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Biodynamic Calendar for Indoor Gardening by MoonBox analyses
        astrological data in your time zone. The algorithms were created in
        collaboration with a professional astrologist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app highlights 8 main actions that are required to properly care for
        your houseplants. It clearly presents what to do in your indoor garden
        at any time, and what to avoid until a better moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, each type of plant has its own care needs. Please consider
        these first. To advance from there - follow the app.
      </p>
      <p>Enjoy ðŸ˜˜</p>
